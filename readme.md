# SumUp

Simple test for a job application at SumUp, Berlin. It's a simple responsive digest of shares and likes on Facebook and Twitter, with a timeline of recent tweets containing #sumup. Here's some of the stuff I'm using:

- Angular JS;
- Normalize.css;
- SASS and Bourbon;
- Golden Grid System;
- PHP Wrapper for Twitter calls (OAuth);
- TypeKit.
